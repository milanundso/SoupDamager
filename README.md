## 📍 Soup Zones

The plugin defines several **hardcoded soup zones** in the **main class**:

```java
// Initialization of all soup zones
org.bukkit.World world = Bukkit.getWorlds().get(0);
soupZones.add(new SoupZone(new Location(world, -9993, 41, 109946), 5.0));
soupZones.add(new SoupZone(new Location(world, -10002, 41, 109945), 7.0));
soupZones.add(new SoupZone(new Location(world, -10011, 41, 109946), 10.0));
soupZones.add(new SoupZone(new Location(world, -10016, 41, 109953), 6.0));
```
